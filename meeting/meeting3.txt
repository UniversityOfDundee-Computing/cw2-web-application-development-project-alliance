1. Challenges

The team encountered several challenges:

* Discrepant data returned from the TMDb API

* Difficulty implementing the Gemini API with proper prompt to analyse user input

* Disagreements during GitHub pushes

* Difficulty mapping moods to appropriate movie genres

* Layout inconsistencies across different screen sizes

Resolution:

These issues were resolved through frequent team meetings, code reviews, and improved collaboration. The introduction of the Gemini API (as API 1) significantly improved the mood-to-genre mapping process.

2. Outcomes & Next Steps

* Finalized project structure and selected technologies

* Resolved early-stage development hurdles

* Final phase to focus on interface refinement, review, testing, and full implementation
